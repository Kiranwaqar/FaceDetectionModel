# Real-Time Face Detection with OpenCV

This project leverages **OpenCV** and **Gradio** to detect faces in uploaded images using the **Haar Cascade Classifier**. The system highlights detected faces with green rectangles.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you'll need the following:

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `opencv-python`, `gradio`, `numpy`

## Installation Guide

1. **Clone the repository:**

git clone https://github.com/Kiranwaqar/FaceDetection.git

2. **Install dependencies:**

pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Launch the application:**

Run the following command to start the face detection service:

python facedetection.py

This will open a Gradio interface in your web browser.

## How It Works

After launching, upload an image through the Gradio interface.

The system will detect faces in the image and outline them with green rectangles.
